Its a basic music player created using Python .
Its uses library like Pygame ,tkinter and OS for running the program .
For installation of pygame and pkinter library 
write the command in the console/terminal based on the code editor you use 
               for pygame: pip install pygame
               for tkinter:pip install tkinter
For uninstalling those libray replce the install word with uninstall and You are all done.
